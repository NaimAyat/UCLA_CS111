This is my submission for Lab 0 (Warm-Up). It is a tarball containing the
following files:
		- README
		- Makefile
		- lab0.c
		- breakpoint.png
		- backtrace.png

Makefile: This builds lab0 using the -o, -g, -Wall, and -Wextra flags. I've
written a series of five checks. They determine whether the program correctly
exits with codes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
    - check0: Compares an input file to an output file and determines whether
		  the program properly copies contents from the prior to the latter.
		- check1: Attempts to run the program with an invalid option.
		- check2: Attempts to run the program with a non-existent input file.
		- check3: Attempts to run the program without write permissions to the
			output file.
		- check4: Ensures that a segmentation fault can be properly caught.
Moreover, "clean" serves to delete all files created by the Makefile. "Dist"
builds the distribution tarball.

lab0.c: This is the only source file for this project. As per the spec, it is a
program that copies its standard input to its standard output by reading from
file descriptor 0 (until encountering an EOF) and writing to file descriptor 1.

breakpoint.png: This confirms that the fault pointer is indeed NULL. I set a
breakpoint at line 115, where the NULL pointer gets dereferenced in order to
force a segmentation fault. The screenshot shows that I am trying to access
memory at address 0x0, meaning I'm trying to dereference a NULL pointer.

backtrace.png: This simply displays a backtrace from the segmentation fault. At
this point, the segfault is the only function on the stack.
