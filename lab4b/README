This is my submission for Lab 4B (Beaglebone Sensors).

It is a tarball containing the following files:
   - lab4b.c: a source file for an embedded application that builds and runs
     on a Beaglebone. Gets readings from temperature sensor and generates a
     report as per the spec.
   - Makefile: builds and tests program as per the spec. Includes a short
     smoke test in check.
   - README

Assumptions: temperature calculations are made for an RV5 system. Equivalent
             R3V3 calculations are present as code comments.
