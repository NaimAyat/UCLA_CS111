This is my submission for Lab 1B (Encrypted Network Communication).
It is a tarball containing the following files:
		- README
		- Makefile
		- lab1b-server.c
		- lab1b-client.c
		- my.key

Makefile: This builds lab1b-server.c and lab1b-client.c using the -o, -g,
-lmcrypt, -Wall, and -Wextra flags. "Clean" serves to delete all files created
by the Makefile. "Dist" builds the distribution tarball.

lab1b-server.c: As per the spec, this is a program that establishes a server to
connect with a client, receive the client's commands, and "serve" the client
outputs for those commands. It supports an --encrypt=filename option.

lab1b-client.c: This program opens a connection to the server with through a
port specified by the --port option.

my.key: An encryption key to be used with the server's --encrypt option.
