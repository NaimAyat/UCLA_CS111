This is my submission for Lab 4A (Beaglebone Bring-Up).

It is a tarball containing the following files:
		- my_beaglebone.jpg: a selfie of me holding my assembled Beaglebone.
		- connected.png: a screen shot from a USB terminal command session connected
                     to my system, showing that I gave it a name and configured
                     network access.
		- copy.png: a screen shot from a local session in which I copied a "hello
                world" program from my laptop to my Beaglebone.
		- build_run.png: a screen shot from a WIFI SSH session in which I built and
                     ran a "hello world" program.
		- git.png: a screen shot from a WIFI SSH session in which I installed git
      and cloned a repository.
