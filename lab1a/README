This is my submission for Lab 1A (Terminal I/O and Inter-Process Communication).
It is a tarball containing the following files:
		- README
		- Makefile
		- lab1a.c

Makefile: This builds lab1a.c using the -o, -g, -Wall, and -Wextra flags.
"Clean" serves to delete all files created by the Makefile.
"Dist" builds the distribution tarball.

lab0.c: This is the only source file for this project. As per the spec, it is a
program that establishes:
	1. Character-at-a-time, full duplex terminal I/O
	2. Polled I/O and passing input and output between two processes
