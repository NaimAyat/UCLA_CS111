This is my submission for Lab 3B (File System Consistency Analysis).

It is a tarball containing the following files:
   - lab3b.py: a source file that analyzes a file system summary and reports on
     all discovered inconsistencies.
   - Makefile: builds and runs program as per the spec. Includes dist and
     clean targets.
   - README
