This is my submission for Lab 3A (File System Interpretation).

It is a tarball containing the following files:
   - lab3a.c: a source file that reads the on-disk representation of a file 
     system, analyzes it, and summarizes its contents as per the spec.
   - ext2_fs.h: a slightly simplified version of the Linux header file that 
     defines the format of the EXT2 file system.
   - Makefile: builds and runs program as per the spec. Includes dist and
     clean targets.
   - README
